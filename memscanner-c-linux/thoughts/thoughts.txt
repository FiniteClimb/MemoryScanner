This is my first completed project after about 2 months of working with programming. (by August 2025)

Looking back just now a month later, I already see a lot of questionable and lacking areas in the code.
Therefore, I will not claim it is optimal for any use in general. 
However I would still be happy if you used it and gave feedback.

This will not be updated. 
You are all welcome and encouraged to share thoughts and criticism regardless.

I am currently working on a C++ version that I will also share on here once it's functioning.
